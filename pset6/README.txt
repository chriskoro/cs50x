implements sentiment analysis for tweets

directory: pset6/sentiments

to run: ./tweets cs50
Then run your web server to see a pie chart of the sentiments of this user's tweets
(good, bad, as green / red, etc)

Make sure your API KEY is set from the command line or there will be problems 



directory: pset6

The other 3 files (caesar, greedy, mario) were also required for this problem set- 
They are implementations of the same programs I made earlier in C problem sets.
to run them: (for example) mario.py
