C$50 finance: This is a simple stock-trading website that
allows user to get quotes of, buy and sell stocks, view their
transaction history, and add cash to their account (extra feature)
Since this is a graphical user interface, the user can rely on the 
web application itself to explain how to interact with it (self-explanatory)

To run: enter flask run into your command prompt and open your web server
You should be able to sign in with the letter "a" as both the username and password
or with username: chriskoro and password: abc  to see more transactions

Took me around 20 hours to implement (not my first foray into sql)
